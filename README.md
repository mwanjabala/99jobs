# NEEDS TO BE MODIFIED TO SCALABLE DESIGN

# About 
99jobs is a short term employment system I am designing to work efficently in a developing country like Zambia. First of all, the job boards I have come across in the country only cater for professional employment. To remedy this, I am developing a website , Sela Tubombeko, which is crafted to connect people seeking unprofessional short term jobs with people who need unprofessional jobs like digging a pit or heavy lifting done for them. Second, the current systems appear to have been setup for developed countries where it would be justified to assume the population can read and have considerable access to the internet. However, Sela Tubombeko is not designed to work on its own. As part of the 99jobs system, the website will work with kiosk operators to help the target market navigate the system. Kiosk operators will use a laptop or tablet to access the internet. 

# Components 
1. Sela Tubombeko website 
2. Kiosks 

# Payment 
Most of the kiosks in the country, particularly the capital city Lusaka are owned by money tranfer organzations. 99jobs is designed to incorporate these organizations in the system to coordinate payment and perhaps provide other resources like tablets or internet.
